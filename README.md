# Java DSA Learning Repository

This repository contains my Java practice files and folders while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I am pushing all my files (arrays, loops, conditionals, etc.) here as I learn and practice.

## 📂 Structure
- `basics/` -> Basic Concepts
- `conditionals/` -> Programs using if-else, switch, etc.
- `loops/` -> Programs using loops  
- `arrays/` -> Programs related to arrays
- `strings/` ->Programs related to strings 
  

- More folders will be added as I progress 🚀

## 🎯 Goal
- Improve Java programming skills  
- Build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Track my learning journey on GitHub
